TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team ##)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: __2 vs 1__
- Total points committed vs. done: __11 vs 8__
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): __58h 30m / 48h vs 47h 45m__
  
  
   During the initial estimate, we had planned 48 hours of work (8 hours for six people). After the daily scrum, we needed new tasks related to e.g. reviewing the concepts of the React Js framework, so after adding these hours, we reached 58 hours and 30 minutes. However, the number of hours spent was 47 h 45 min because we took time away from the tasks with less priority.

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
  - estimate hours per task average: 3.9
  - estimate standard deviation: 2.91
  - actual hours per task average: 3.18
  - actual standard deviation: 2.65
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1: 0.23

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: /
  - Total hours spent: 3h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 27
  - Coverage (if available): /
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: /
  - Total hours spent: 1h  
 
 We didn't create tasks for tests, so we didn't estimate them.Anyway we did them and we spent some hours in doing them. The time spent on tests was already included in the total time spent on the tasks.

- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 1h 30m
  - Total hours spent: 1h 30m
  


## ASSESSMENT

-  **What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?**

    We didn't realize we have some problems regarding knowledge of some technology we used and there were some aspects we didn't think we need, so we had to add more tasks during the sprint.

- **What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?**

- **Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?** 
  
  This is our first retrospective, so we didn't have any goals.
  
- **Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?**

    For the same reason of the previous answer we didn't have anything to achieve.

- **Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)**
  - **More coordination**: in addition to the daily scrum use a tool(like Notion) where each team member for each shared task is able to write comments and communications.
  - **Better task assignation and estimation**


- **One thing you are proud of as a Team!!**

    We are proud of the fact that togheter we have been able to help each other and have also been able to acquire new knowledge that we are going to use in the next project.
