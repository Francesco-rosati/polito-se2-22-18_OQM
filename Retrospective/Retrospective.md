TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team ##)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: __2 vs 1__
- Total points committed vs. done: __11 vs 8__
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): __58h 30m/48h vs 47h 45m__ ci sono 2 ore di review web application, 1h 30 di navbar implementation, backend related to waiting time 5h, navigation login state 2h che non avevamo stimato inizialmente

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!)

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
  - estimate hours per task average: 3.9
  - estimate standard deviation: 2.91
  - actual hours per task average: 3.18
  - actual standard deviation: 2.65
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1: 0.23

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 1h 30m
  - Total hours spent: 1h 30m
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
  We didn't realize we have some problem regarding knowledge of some technology we used and there were some aspect we didn't think we need, so we had to add more tasks during the sprint.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - more coordination: create a file were each of team members can write if they have some free time or they need help.
  - better task assignation

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
